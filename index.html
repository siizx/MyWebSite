        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a videogames addict who studies computer science sometimes.
        </p>
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm studying to get a computer science degree. Painfully slow pace.
            I hope the saying "He who goes slowly, goes far" is true...
